# SmartSweepers
My undergraduate thesis project from 2014 - 2015, testing the emergent behaviour of machine-learning agents trained using the NEAT algorithm while foraging for food. Code has not been touched in 7 years and was pretty hacky, so I'll need to review to get it running again.

Code originally adopted from Smart Sweepers from http://www.ai-junkie.com

## To Do
Review old code and update to C++17. Fix and bugs or code rot.
